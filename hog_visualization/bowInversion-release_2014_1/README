This package contains Matlab source code for visualizing quantization effects for bag-of-visual-words representationsi as described in:

Alexander Freytag and Johannes Ruehle and Paul Bodesheim and Erik Rodner and Joachim Denzler:
"Seeing through bag-of-visual-word glasses: towards understanding quantization effects in feature extraction methods".

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% adapt this file according to your system, including path to 3party projects.
% Mirrors for downloading libraries not yet existing in your systems are displayed.
initWorkspace


% NOTE - additional data needed
Calling inverseHog for the first time will download the paired-ditionary file, which is around 15MB.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
                             DEMO 1
            Invert a given image, following the BoW paradigm
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%run the whole *inversion* pipeline, including local feature extraction, codebook generation, inversion, and impainting
out = demo1_inversionPipeline

% visualize the resulting image
figure; imshow ( out.imgHoggleBow )



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
                             DEMO 2
     Invert a given image and randomly shuffle its parts
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%run the whole pipeline, including local feature extraction, codebook generation, inversion, and impainting
out = demo2_imageInvertedAndJittered

% visualize the resulting image
figure; imshow ( out.imgHoggleBow )

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
                             DEMO 3
               Evaluate a standard BoW-pipeline
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% NOTE - dataset needed
% This demo uses the 15 scenes dataset. You need to adapt data/init15Scenes.m according to the location of the 15scenes dataset on your machine.
% The dataset is avaible at http://www.cs.illinois.edu/homes/slazebni/research/scene_categories.zip

% NOTE - setup 15Scenes dataset
% after downloading the dataset and extracing it to /HOME/MYHOME/MYFOLDER15SCENES/
% go to folder of dataset
cd /HOME/MYHOME/MYFOLDER15SCENES/
% run the script provided with this repo to write all image filenames into class-specific filelists
/HOME/MYHOME/MYCODE/bowClassification.git/data/list_files.sh jpg 15Scenes.txt filelist
% copy file with references to the filelists into the data directory (alternative, change the path to this file in the demo3_script)
cp /HOME/MYHOME/MYFOLDER15SCENES/15Scenes.txt /HOME/MYHOME/MYCODE/bowClassification.git/data/15Scenes.txt

%run the whole *classification* pipeline, including local feature extraction, codebook generation, quantization, training, and testing
out = demo3_evaluateBoWPerformance

% NOTE - small subset only
% per default, demo3 only runs on a subset of the 15scenes dataset. You might want to change the settings in order to evaluate the pipeline on the whole dataset, or even a completely different one.
