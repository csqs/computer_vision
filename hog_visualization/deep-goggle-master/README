Experiments from the paper
--------------------------

To run the experiments used for our publication and replicate their results
please follow the instructions below

Get the images
Download/soft link the imagenet validation images into experiments/data/imagenet12-val
Download/soft link the stock abstrack images into experiments/data/stock

For any of the cases below you need to run the following in matlab

    cd experiments;
    experiment_setup;

I) Experiment for a single reconstruction across all layers of

    experiment_cnn;

See the results in data/results/ #TODO - List of the files relevant here
TODO - Add experiment_xxx files here as and when they are documented.


Setting up and running your own networks
----------------------------------------

1. Create a network (net) that is compatible with matconvnet vl_simplenn function.
2. Run dg\_setup.m in matlab
3. Run the network forward to generate a target reference representation y0
4. Call res = invert\_nn(net, y0, \[options\]);
5. res.output\{end\} is the required reconstruction.
